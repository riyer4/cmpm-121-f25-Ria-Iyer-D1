# CMPM 121 D1 Project

I made a Taco Bell cookie clicker with five different upgrades: Baja Blast, Nachos, Tacos, Gordita, and Crunchwrap Supreme.

The changes I made based on the demos I have seen from my peers include:

1. https://kupodupo.github.io/CMPM-121-D1-Incremental-Game/
   a. I really liked the circle around the carrot and decided to add a box around my main button to make it pop out more.
2. https://uriosteguim12.github.io/cmpm-121-f25-d1/
   a. I liked how there was a box around each upgrade and added a box around all of my upgrades with a gradient so it looks better and cleaner.
